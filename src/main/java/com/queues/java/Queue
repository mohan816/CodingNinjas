It is a abstract data structure like Stack, Which means we won't focus much on the implementation we just use it's functions.

Queue is an interface, if we need to create an object then we have to use LinkedList.

Below are the some important functions:
1) offer() -> To insert an element to the queue
2) poll() -> To remove an element and it return the element, if element is not there then it will return null.
3) peek() -> It will return the first element of the queue, if element is not there then it will return null.
4) size() -> It will return the size of a queue.
5) isEmpty() -> Return ture if the queue is empty else it will return false.
