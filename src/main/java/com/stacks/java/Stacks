Stacks:

It is an abstract data type, here we don't dig much how the data is stored instead we just use it's feature.
It's behaviour is LIFO which means Last In First Out. In programming stack is used in Recursion, when each function call's stored in the memory
area called call stack. Here the last called function will comes out of the call stack at first and the same will continue for others as well.

Basic Operations in Stack:
1) push() -> Insert an element in the stack
2) pop() -> Removes an element in the stack and return it.
3) peek() -> Return the top most element of the stack.
4) size() - > Returns the size of stack
5) isEmpty() -> It returns true if the stack is empty and returns false if the stack is not empty.
