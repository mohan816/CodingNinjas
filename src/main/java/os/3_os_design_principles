Policy: Set of rules or plan
Mechanism: It is a method that we follow to fulfill the policy.

Elements of OS: Abstraction, Policy, Mechanism

OS Principles:

1) Mechanism and policy should be separated
     Many applications should support single mechanism and this mechanism should support multiple policies. 
2) Common use cases: Like who all are the users, how much load it will handle and the what kind of applications will use this OS
3) Operating system should be macro manage not micro manage:
    Operation system should be used whenever it's and not for everything
