Turn Around Time:
   The time duration between the terminated state and ready state (this is taken from first time process enters the ready state).

Wait Time:
   The time process spends waiting for the CPU

Response Time:
   The time duration between process getting into ready queue and process getting CPU for the first time.
   
   
First Come First Serve Algorithm: FCFS
                In this algorithm, the process which comes to ready state at first that will dispatch to the CPU. Because of
this approach we face the problems like Convoy Effect or Starving.
   
How can we calculate turn around time and waiting time?

TurnAroundTime = FinishTime - ArrivalTime
WaitTime = TurnAroundTime - BurstTime

Process ID    ||     Arrival Time ||  Burst Time
P1                   5                  4
p2                   0                  3
p3                   1                  2
p4                   7                  1
p5                   4                  6

Solution
  Process ID      Finish Time      TurnAroundTime     WaitTime
  p0                3                 3                   0
  p3                5                 4                   2
  p5                11                7                   1
  p1                15                10                  6
  p4                16                9                   8                
   
Convoy Effect:
Convoy Effect is nothing but if the multiple process are in the ready state, and one process is dispatched to the running state 
and it's taking long time to complete it because of this other process becomes idle. This concept is called convoy effect or Starving.

Shortest Job First Algorithm:
 In this algorithm the process with less burst time will execute at first. In order to resolve the problem of starvation, but actually this
 algorithm will also wont solve the problem.
 
 For an example at the 0th arrival time the process with 100 burst time comes at first in the ready and no other process are there in the ready
 queue, so this process dispatched to the cpu and it started to execute for 100 seconds. Now some other process comes at 10th arrival time
 and the burst time of those process are 5, this process has less burst time but still it has to wait for process which is running on the
 CPU to complete. So in this algorithm also the starvation is there.
