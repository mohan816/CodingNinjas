First Understand degree of Multi-Programming:
If the process are more in main memory then we can say degree of Multi-Programming is high else say we can say it's low.

Different types of Schedulers:
1) Long Term Scheduler(LTS)
2) Short Term Scheduler(STS)
3) Medium Term Scheduler(MTS)

Long Term Scheduler:
 It is responsible to change the process from new state to ready state. And it's happening in the job queue, so we can also call it
 Job Scheduler. The degree of multi-programming is high when compared  to other two schedulers. Because it will move the process from 
 Secondary memory to Main Memory.
 
 Short Term Scheduler:
 It is responsible to dispatch the process from Ready state to CPU. We can also call it as CPU Scheduler. At a time only one process will
 be executed. And the degree of multi programming is less when compared to LTS and high when compared to MTS.
 
 Medium Term Scheduler:
 It's responsible to move the process from Running state to Waiting state. Once the process is moved from running state to Waiting state which
 means main memory to Secondary Memory. It's also called Process Switching Scheduler. The degree of multi programming is low when compared to
 other two Schedulers.
