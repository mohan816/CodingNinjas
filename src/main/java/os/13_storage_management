The Persistent storage in our system is Disk, there are two types Disk
    1) Magnetic Disk or HDD
    2) Non Magnetic Disk or SDD

How Magnetic Disk Works:
1) The rotating Magnetic Surface is Platter.
2) The mechanical arm where read and write head attached.
3) The mechanical arm along with read and write moves around the platter, and it's reads and writes the data stored on the platter.
4) The platter attached with the spindle and this spindle rotates with the speed of 5400 to 7200 rpm.

The data's organized in the magnetic disk using tracks, sectors and Cylinders.
-> Platter is divided into several circular discussions, this circular sections are called tracker.
-> Track is further divided into sectors, where data's are stored. Each read and write operations are performed on sectors. The smallest unit
   in HDD is called Sector. Usually the size of sector is 512 bytes, sudo fdisk -l | grep "Sector Size" (command to find Sector Size)
-> A straight line of track at one arm rotation is called Cylinder.
-> The time taken by the read and write head to move from one track to another is seek time.

Seek time determines the performance of OS operations on the disk.

SSD:
   It doesn't use any mechanical part like Magnetic Disk.
   It used NAND based flash memory to read and write on the disk
   Speed of SSD is generally faster than HDD because it doesn't use any mechanical part, it's 10 times faster than HDD.
   
 How SSD works:
 1) The smallest unit is called pages
 2) The size of page is 4kb, usually 128 pages combine together to from blocks. Data's are stored in the form of blocks in both SSD and HDD.
 3) The size of each block is 128 * 4, every time read and write operations performs on the size of 516kb(128 * 4).
